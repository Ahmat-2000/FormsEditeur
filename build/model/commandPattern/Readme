# Linear undo

Linear undo is implemented with a stack (last in first out (LIFO) data structure) that stores a history 
of all executed commands. When a new command is executed it is added to the top of stack. Therefore, only 
the last executed command can be undone and removed from the history. Undo can be repeated as long as the 
history is not empty.

# Restricted linear model

The restricted linear model is an augmentation of the linear undo model. It satisfies the above described 
stable execution property for linear undo, because this model does not keep the property if a command is done 
while the history list includes other commands. The restricted linear model clears the history list before a new 
command is added. But other restrictions are available, too. For example, the size of the history list can be 
restricted or when a defined size is reached, the first executed command is deleted from the list.
